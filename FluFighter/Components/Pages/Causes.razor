        <h1>Causes of Flu</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and lungs.
        There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D.
        Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease almost every winter in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk.
        These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
        Less often, a person might get the flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.
